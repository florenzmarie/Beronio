Why does the raspberry pi functioning?

	The raspberry pi is functioning because the charger used meets the requirement that able the rpi to on, indications are when red light is steadily on
 and the green light is blinking. Another reason is there is an operating system installed. The connecting wires used are in good condition.

	This answer is according to Mr. Salon because he did the troubleshooting on his raspberry pi, the site he searched was elinux.org/R-Pi-troubleshooting.
I also based my answer, on what Mr. Cotacte said because they've tried troubleshooting the raspberry pi.

OBSERVATION
	When we troubleshoot the system unit, the reason why it is not functioning is because the powersupply is defective. Eventhough the CPU fan is functional, we fail
to check the motherboard because the powersupply has a problem. We also observe that the parts of the system is not clean, it has lots of dusts and other components are 
so old which we think an additional reason why it is not functioning.

	We think that we need to change the fuse of the powersupply, if it is still not functioning change the system unit's powersupply. When you already change the 
powersupply and the problem is still there buy a new system unit.

Note: Make sure that all the components and other parts of the system unit are clean.
